# Respiro

**Respiro** is a project that aims to wed **Crowdsourced Health Information** (such as incidences of respiratory problems with geolocation data, from SMS through *Twilio* and audio through *Amazon's Alexa*), and publically available data derived from **NASA Satellite Imagery**. This data was analyzed and visualized through Wolfram.

Such an approach allows us :
  - **Better Understanding of Illness** : Through Machine Learning, we can better correlate various environmental conditions with respiratory illnesses. In that way, we can quantifiably understand the nuanced causes of respiratory distress from statistics.
  - **Better Access to Information and Care** : This system allows us to reach people (and therefore metadata) that were before now hard to reach. We can get more complete (and therefore more accurate) information about 
  - **The Ability to Influence Health Outcomes**:  Another major benefit of us building a crowdsourcing platform for health data is that it allows us to reach the people we get data from, and positively affect both their (and others') health outcomes. We could text someone in an area of high pollen levels, for example, and warn them that they may want to wear a mask or have antihistimines on hand.

Technologies used: **Node.js**, **NodeRED**, **AWS's Lambda**, **IBM's Bluemix**, **Twilio**, **Wolfram Language and Cloud**, **NASA's GIBS**
